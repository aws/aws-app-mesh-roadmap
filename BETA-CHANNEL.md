# AWS App Mesh Beta Channel

## What are we announcing?

The AWS App Mesh service team is announcing the upcoming availability of a Beta Channel, a new public service endpoint which allows every customer to try out and provide feedback on beta service features before they are generally available. This new service endpoint will be separate from the standard production endpoint, and will be coupled with beta releases of the AWS CLI for App Mesh, allowing customers to test beta features without impacting their current production infrastructure.

## What do I get from the Beta Channel?

With the Beta Channel, you get the opportunity to try out features before we make them generally available. You can play a critical role in helping test the functionality of beta features for your own specific use cases. You're encouraged to provide feedback to the App Mesh team that helps us ensure we're meeting the most important requirements of our customers. In other words: your voice in the beta period will help shape the features of App Mesh so that we can deliver the best possible solution for you.

## How can I on-board?

The Beta Channel will be available to all existing AWS customers. To on-board to the new endpoint, you can download beta versions of the AWS CLI JSON configuration for App Mesh. These beta versions will be made available via GitHub issues on the [AWS App Mesh public roadmap](https://github.com/aws/aws-app-mesh-roadmap).

In the future we may release beta SDKs for all languages.

To preview upcoming features for AWS App Mesh and get information on how you can test and provide feedback, check out our [AWS App Mesh public roadmap](https://github.com/aws/aws-app-mesh-roadmap) on GitHub. Beta features will listed in our GitHub issues page with a “Beta” label.


## How long do I have to provide feedback on a preview feature?

The feedback period will vary depending on the size and complexity of the feature being introduced. The minimal comment period will be 14 days from release to the preview endpoint before it will be released in production. We may opt to extend the feedback period for specific features.

## What level of support is provided for the Beta Channel?

While we encourage you to provide feedback and bug reports directly on our GitHub roadmap issue, we understand you may have sensitive data to share, or have found an issue you do not feel is safe to disclose publicly. For these issues, you can contact AWS Support or email us directly at aws-appmesh-feedback@amazon.com.

## Is my data secure on the beta endpoint?

Yes. The AWS App Mesh beta endpoint is given the same level of security as the standard production endpoint.

## Is my data durable on the beta endpoint?

Due to the desire of getting features in the hands of customers early for feedback, AWS App Mesh does not guarantee the durability of customer data provided to the beta endpoint. We may, from time to time, reset the data store behind the preview endpoint to guarantee the best long-term customer experience. Before this occurs, the AWS App Mesh team will announce the reset and provide time and guidance for you to save your existing resources so they can be replaced once the reset has completed. Long-term, we will invest in open-source tooling to help you migrate your production resources to the beta endpoint.

## When will the Beta Channel be available?

Coming soon.  Details will be posted here as they become available.
